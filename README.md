Welcome to unanchacc-gpt! This conversational chatbot is driven by OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o, bringing you natural, intelligent, and engaging interactions.

## :pushpin: Introduction

This repository offers a simple template for implementing a chatbot interface. The chatbot backend supports streaming responses and integrates three built-in tools:

- [Code Interpreter](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/code-interpreter)
- [File Search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search)
- [Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/function-calling)

This implementation is a modified version of OpenAIâ€™s publicly available reference implementation.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **This repository code is not intended for direct use in production**. This is a minimal chatbot template intended for demonstration purposes only. For production use, implement a robust client/server architecture and refactor the code to align with your conversational experience goals.
